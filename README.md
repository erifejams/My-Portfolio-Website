# My-Portfolio-Website
This is my website portfolio. I can't remember where I got the bootstrap for the website, since I did it long ago, but i attached the github of when I first started building where you can see the changes, so the difference can be seen in the commits.

The website can be visualisedd by clicking on any of the html pages. You can click through the different menu buttons to go through each page. Any of the elements can be clicked. I also attached my github because I can't remember where I got the original bootstrap, since I did it awhile ago.
Here is my github, so the commits can be seen, that I changed the website.
